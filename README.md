# compostinglatrine
Engineers Without Borders - Water Preservation Project

This project was part of a water preservation effort in El Limon, Nicaragua as part of a Engineers Without Borders collaboration
with the local community.

This project sought to replace pit latrines closest to the community's well to protec them from contamination. The community wanted
to use composting toilets instead. 

I partnered with a structural engineer to model this composting toilet in Solidworks and this is the final result. We used these drawings
during our implementation trip in May 2017.
